            My biggest enemy is the <b>human feeling</b> itself.<br><br>
            The second biggest enemy, which everyone can say too for themselves, are the <b>times</b>.<br>
            Only <b>time</b> will tell how someone feels, and how you feel can change the <b>times</b>.<br><br>
            I gave them everything I had; now I have yet to give them my <b>time</b>.<br>
            <b>Waiting</b> is painful, but what's more painful are the <b>feelings</b> that come with it.<br>
            Depending on the <b>answer</b>, I could have my <b>dreams</b> come true, or shatter into pieces I can't even count.<br><br>
            When <b>time</b> comes, someone will come and, piece by piece, rebuild me.<br>
            That <b>time</b> will come, knock on my door, but I'm not going to open the door for him.<br>
            That <b>time</b> may never come when I can trust someone for their <b>words</b> again over their <b>actions</b>.<br><br>
            <b>People</b> change over <b>time</b>; let that be a year, five years, or even just a few weeks.<br>
            <b>Human feelings</b> change.<br>
            I can never trust your <b>feelings</b> again, but don't let that stop you from coming back, as I'm still <b>waiting</b>.<br><br>
            Even if I were to get hurt, I was born to be <b>hurt</b>.<br>
            This is my <b>fate</b>, and I accept it gracefully.<br>
            I will carry my pieces in a jar and give them to you.<br>
            But that is only if you promise to never scatter them around again.<br><br>
            You’ll be getting this when you’re in your right mind.<br><br>
            <b>Yours forever,<br> Riley</b>
