            My biggest <b>enemy</b> is the human <b>feeling</b> itself.<br>
            The second biggest <b>enemy</b> which everyone can say too for themselves are the <b>times</b>.<br>
            Only <b>time</b> will tell how someone <b>feels</b>.<br>
            And how you <b>feel</b> can change the <b>times</b>.<br><br>

            I gave them everything I had, now I have yet to give them my <b>time</b>.<br>
            Waiting is <b>painful</b>, what's more <b>painful</b> are the <b>feelings</b> that come with it.<br>
            Depending on the <b>answer</b> I could have my <b>dreams</b> come true,<br>
            Or shatter into pieces I can't even count.<br><br>

            When <b>time</b> comes, someone will come and piece by piece rebuild me.<br>
            That <b>time</b> will come knock on my door,<br>
            But I'm not going to open the door for <b>him</b>.<br>
            That <b>time</b> may never come when I can trust someone for their <b>words</b> again over <b>actions</b>.<br>
            People change over <b>time</b>, let that be a year or five,<br>
            Or even just a few weeks.<br>
            Human <b>feelings</b> change.<br><br>

            I can never trust your <b>feelings</b> again,<br>
            But don't let that stop you from coming back.<br>
            As I'm still <b>waiting</b>,<br>
            Even if I were to get <b>hurt</b>.<br>
            I normalized being <b>hurt</b>, this is my <b>fate</b> and I accept gracefully.<br>
            I will carry my pieces in a <b>jar</b> and give them to you.<br>
            But that is only if you promise to never scatter them around again.<br>
            You'll be getting this when you're in your right mind.<br><br>

            Yours forever,<br>
            Riley
